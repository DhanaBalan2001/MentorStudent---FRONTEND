  4. Backend Setup Process :

       -  Create an Express server : Use Express to handle HTTP requests and define routes.

       -  Connect to MongoDB : Use Mongoose to define schemas for mentors and students.

       -  Set up routes and controllers : Create separate routes for mentors and students. Assign business logic in controllers and services.

       -  Handle Errors : Implement error-handling middleware to handle database errors or validation issues.

       -  Start the server : Use app.listen() to start the server at a specific port (e.g., 5000).
